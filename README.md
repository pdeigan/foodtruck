# Foodtruck

This project pulls data from the San Francisco food truck vendor database and does some simple breakdowns of the provided data. 

To run the application, pull the source code to your machine. From the foodtruck directory, run the following:
```elixir
iex -S mix
Foodtruck.run()
```

From here you will be prompted to run certain commands that are available.
